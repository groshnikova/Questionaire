It includes the following tests:\u2022 Endpoint Validation: Validate if the API endpoints respond to requests as expected.\nExample: Testing if the GET /user/{id} endpoint retrieves the correct user details for\na given ID.\nInput Validation: Test how the API handles various input scenarios:\no Valid inputs.\no Invalid inputs (e.g., incorrect data types or missing required fields).\no Boundary values (e.g., maximum or minimum allowable input sizes).\nExample: Testing an API that accepts a date range to ensure it rejects malformed dates\nlike 32-13-2025.\nBusiness Logic Testing: Validate that the API implements the defined business rules\ncorrectly and completely. Example: For an e-commerce API, ensure the POST\n/applyCoupon endpoint allows discounts only on eligible products.\nDependency Validation: Test how APIs interact with other services. Example: If an API\ntriggers a payment gateway, test if the API handles responses like success, failure, and\ntimeout correctly.\nTip: Use tools like Postman to design and execute functional test cases effectively.\nAutomate repetitive tests with libraries like REST Assured for scalability."
